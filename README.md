## Telegram Commands

To connect a regular channel or group, just add the bot to the group with administrator rights.

If your group is divided into forums, then in the forum topic you need to send the command `/connect` to the chat so
that the bot can bind to the topic.

> Note
> 
> When publishing messages in topics that are closed from users, you must grant the bot rights to manage topics.
